## Compute in Memory(CIM)

### What is Compute in Memory?
In the tradition computer architecture named **Von Neumann architecture**, this kind of architecture combine the **insturctions** with **database** together. Nowadays, the CPUs have processing speed up to several Giga Hz that the CPU calculation speed is much higher visit speed. Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every newer generation of CPU. Here are some solutions to break Vo Neumann's bottlenack.
1. Providing a cache between the CPU and the main memory
2. providing separate caches or separate access paths for data and instructions (the so-called Modified Harvard architecture)
3. using branch predictor algorithms and logic
4. providing a limited CPU stack or other on-chip scratchpad memory to reduce memory access
5. Compute in Memory

### How does Compute in Memory work?
For example, a cook xiaoming used do these process in the restaurant. First, the consumers tell him which dishes they ordered. Then xiaoming will prepera the dishes as requirment one by one, like pick up cabbage in address A, take the pork in address B etc. Finally, xiaoming will cook the dishes and give them to consumers. Now xiaoming thinks this cooking process is too slow, he want to shorten process. He found that his cooking speed is fast most time consumption is in the picking process. Thus, he move the cooker nearby cabbage and pork. When someone order this dishes, he will easily get all componenets and cook them in fast speed. 

From the example above, the memory and compute process are combined together, like the automatic food processor. The processing speed has been greatly improved, but this unit could only do one process.
